## My process

### Built with

- Figma design -> to hand code -> to deploy
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox & Grid CSS
- [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpowers
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot more about using CSS grid. I completed the project with flexbox, but then ventured to learn CSS grid from `https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack`. I completed all 80 challenges and now have a much better grasp on the application of CSS grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Attack](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack) - This helped me understand CSS grid on a much higher level. I now have another great tool in my toolbox.
